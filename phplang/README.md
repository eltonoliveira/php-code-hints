# Better NetBeans PHPStubs
The PHP stub files from [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/) are generated
automatically based on the PHP documentation sources. But they lack a
lot of information in daily usage. This is an ongoing attempt to make
the stubs better.

## Installation
Simply copy all the files from this repository **over** the original
stub files.

Under Windows the path is: `%NETBEANS_INSTALL_DIR%\php\phpstubs\phpruntime`
